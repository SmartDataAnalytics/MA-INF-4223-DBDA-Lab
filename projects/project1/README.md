# Particle Swarm Optimization using Spark framework

This project is upon the implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm utilizing the concept of parallel programming using spark RDD. Evaluation of the implementation has been done using various metrics such as number of cores and workers in a cluster, particle size, dimension and also by providing a comparison between a sequential and distributed implementation of PSO.

## Spark Configuration changes in the project
- Set the master node
- Set releavent appliaction name
- Set eventlog directory

Note: Export jars of both classes to the classpath

Three objective functions with the same name have been included the the code. Uncomment the one which needs to be tested and comment rest.
